Sample Avatar Images to Add
============================

To test the avatar selection functionality, add some image files to this directory:

Recommended sample avatars:
1. avatar_pirate.png - A pirate character
2. avatar_ninja.png - A ninja character  
3. avatar_robot.png - A robot character
4. avatar_wizard.png - A wizard character
5. avatar_viking.png - A viking character

You can download free avatar images from:
- OpenGameArt.org
- Kenney.nl (free game assets)
- Flaticon.com
- Or create your own simple avatars

Once you add image files to this folder, they will automatically appear in the avatar selection dialog when you tap on a player's avatar circle.
